# SecureSight Dashboard - Technical Assessment

A full-stack dashboard for the fictional CCTV monitoring software, SecureSight. This application allows users to view, manage, and analyze security incidents from multiple camera feeds in real-time.

**Live URL:** [Vercel Deployment](https://securesight-dashboard-ucxi.vercel.app/)

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Dynamic Video Player:** Features a main player that displays a unique video for each incident, along with two secondary video feeds for situational awareness.
  * **Animated Incident List:** A fully interactive list where incidents can be selected with smooth entrance animations.
  * **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
  * **Interactive Timeline (Extra Credit):** A timeline at the bottom visualizes all incidents over a 24-hour period. Clicking a marker on the timeline updates the entire UI.

> **Note on "Resolve" Functionality:** The "Resolve Incident" feature, including its API route and UI button, was fully implemented but temporarily disabled due to a persistent, environment-specific build error on Vercel. The working code for this feature can be reviewed in the project's Git history.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Decisions

  * **Framework:** **Next.js 15 (App Router)** was used as required, providing a modern full-stack environment.
  * **Database & ORM:** **Neon (Serverless Postgres)** with **Prisma** was chosen for its scalability and compatibility with serverless environments like Vercel.
  * **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** was used for its utility-first approach, enabling the rapid development of the custom and responsive design.
  * **Animation:** **Framer Motion** was used to add professional entrance animations and smooth layout transitions.
